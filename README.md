# Hanzi Writer Japanese Data

## About

This is the character data used by [Hanzi Writer](https://github.com/chanind/hanzi-writer) for Japanese.
**NOTE: This is currently experimental**

This data is published in a separate repo from Hanzi Writer for the following reasons:
- This data is licensed separately from the Hanzi Writer source code.
- This allows users who wish to import character data in NPM to do so without forcing everyone to download the character data along with Hanzi Writer.
- Publishing on NPM makes this data available on the [jsdelivr CDN](https://www.jsdelivr.com/package/npm/hanzi-writer-data-jp), so data can be loaded via, for instance, https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/hanzi-writer-data-jp@latest/私.json. 

Check out [chanind.github.io/hanzi-writer](https://chanind.github.io/hanzi-writer) for more info about Hanzi Writer.

## Usage
Until this is supported directly in Hanzi Writer, you'll need to use a custom `charDataLoader` function to use this data in Hanzi Writer. An example of how you can do that using `fetch` and the content on jsDelivr is shown below:

```
HanziWriter.create('target-div', '私', {
  width: 400,
  height: 400,
  charDataLoader: (char, onLoad, onError) => {
    fetch(`https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/krmanik/hanzi-writer-data-jp@master/data/${char}.json`)
      .then(res => res.json())
      .then(onLoad)
      .catch(onError);
  }
})
```

## Update

Added kana json from [ailectra/kana-json](https://github.com/ailectra/kana-json)

## Current limitations compared with the Chinese data
- This data does not support radicals yet
- This data does not have capped strokes, so there are sharp edges where strokes intersect
